Workplace bullying is a significant issue that can have severe consequences for both individuals and organizations. It can lead to decreased productivity, increased staff turnover, damage to the organization's reputation, and legal liability if not addressed appropriately. Therefore, it is critical to provide training for workplace bullying prevention to employees and managers.

What is Workplace Bullying?
---------------------------

Workplace bullying is defined as repeated, unreasonable behavior directed towards an employee or group of employees that creates a hostile or intimidating work environment. This behavior can take many forms, including verbal abuse, physical aggression, exclusion from social activities, and withholding information necessary for work performance.

Workplace bullying involves a power imbalance, with the bully using their position of authority to intimidate or harass the victim.
