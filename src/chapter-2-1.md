# Overview of Workplace Bullying

Workplace bullying is a significant issue that can have severe consequences for both individuals and organizations. In this chapter, we will provide an overview of workplace bullying, including its definition, prevalence, and impact.

What is Workplace Bullying?
---------------------------

Workplace bullying is defined as repeated, unreasonable behavior directed towards an employee or group of employees that creates a hostile or intimidating work environment. This behavior can take many forms, including verbal abuse, physical aggression, exclusion from social activities, and withholding information necessary for work performance.

Workplace bullying is different from normal workplace conflict, which typically involves disagreements over work-related issues and can be resolved through mediation or negotiation. Workplace bullying involves a power imbalance, with the bully using their position of authority to intimidate or harass the victim.

Prevalence of Workplace Bullying
--------------------------------

Workplace bullying is a widespread problem that affects many workplaces worldwide. According to a 2017 survey by the Workplace Bullying Institute, 19% of workers in the United States have experienced workplace bullying, and another 19% have witnessed it.

Workplace bullying can occur at any level of an organization, from entry-level employees to top executives. It can affect both men and women, although research suggests that women are more likely to experience workplace bullying than men.

Impact of Workplace Bullying
----------------------------

The impact of workplace bullying can be severe and long-lasting. Individuals who experience workplace bullying may suffer from physical and psychological symptoms, including anxiety and depression, sleep disturbances, high blood pressure and other stress-related health problems, and an increased risk of substance abuse and addiction.

In addition to these personal consequences, workplace bullying can also have negative effects on the organization as a whole. These effects may include decreased productivity and morale among employees, increased staff turnover and associated costs, damage to the organization's reputation and brand, and legal liability if the organization fails to prevent or respond appropriately to workplace bullying.

Conclusion
----------

Workplace bullying is a significant issue that affects many workplaces worldwide. By recognizing its definition, prevalence, and impact, organizations can take proactive measures to prevent workplace bullying and create a safe and respectful workplace for all employees.
